# Challenge-2016

This repository contains certain problem statements or the challenges faced by me in 2016, solved in Java-7

LookNSay:

This program is just like its name, it says what it looks at.
For example if in a String like 144 it sees one 1 and two 4 so, it'll write 1124. Like wise it'll continue till the size that user has entered. The next output for same example will be 211214 ans so on.

MultipleLetters:

This program works on a similar basis as LookNSay. But the one difference is that it'll just give the count of consecutive letters appearing in a string only once. For example in a String like AaaBbC, it'll give the output as 3a2b1c.
