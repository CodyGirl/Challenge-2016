# Challenge-2016

This repository contains certain problem statements or the challenges faced by me in 2016, solved in Java-7 and html.

<ol>
  <li><b>Challenge 1 : LookNSay</b><br>
  <ul>
    <br>
    <li>This program is just like its name, it says what it looks at.</li>
    <li>For example: In a String like 144 it will see one 1 and two 4 so, it'll write 1124. Likewise it'll continue till the size that user has entered. The next output for same example will be 211214 ans so on.</li>
  </ul>
  </li> 
  <br>
  <li><b>Challenge 2 : MultipleLetters:</b><br>
    <ul>
    <br>
    <li>This program works on a similar basis as LookNSay.</li>
    <li> But the only difference is that it'll give the count of consecutive letters appearing in a string only once.</li>
    <li> For example: For a String like AaaBbC, it'll give the output as 3a2b1c.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Challenge 3 : My website</b><br>
  <ul>
  <br>
  <li>This folder contains two web pages.</li>
  <li>Bootstrap has been used as a framework.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Challenge 4 : Error Message</b><br>
    <ul>
    <br>
    <li>This program basically takes a list of strings as input and a specific string to be searched as an input.</li>
    <li>Then the string is matched with all the strings present in the list.</li>
    <li>Now those strings having same or upto two letters error with the original string are printed on the screen with a message like:<br>Did you mean "this"? or "this"</li>
    <li>For example: list is {commit,hello,meet} and entered string is comit. so output should be : Did you mean commit?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
