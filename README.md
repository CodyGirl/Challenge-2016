# Challenge-2016

This repository contains certain problem statements or the challenges faced by me in 2016, solved in Java-7

<ol>
  <li><b>LookNSay:</b></br>
  <ul>
    </br>
    <li>This program is just like its name, it says what it looks at.</li>
    <li>For example: In a String like 144 it will see one 1 and two 4 so, it'll write 1124. Likewise it'll continue till the size that user has entered. The next output for same example will be 211214 ans so on.</li>
  </ul>
  </li> 
  </br>
  <li><b>MultipleLetters:</b></br>
    <ul>
    </br>
    <li>This program works on a similar basis as LookNSay.</li>
    <li> But the only difference is that it'll give the count of consecutive letters appearing in a string only once.</li>
    <li> For example: For a String like AaaBbC, it'll give the output as 3a2b1c.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
